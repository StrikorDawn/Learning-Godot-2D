# Overview

This program demonstrates the basics of what can be done in 2D Godot platformers. There are 3 playable levels with 30 available collectables per level.
This game does have controller support, and if you want to try the game you can download the EXE file and run stand alone without the engine.
The goal of the the game is to collect as many collectables as you can and reach the trophy at the end of the level.

I made this game as a way for me to get familiar with the Godot Game Engine and GDScript language.
I have been wanting to make my own game since I was 15, so this project marks the beginning of my
journey as a Game Dev.
